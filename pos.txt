Curtis Painter...we have a chance again! Can't believe Kerry Collins didn't throw us a pick-six tonight
It looks like the Curtis Painter era of Colts may begin tonight!
Kerry Collins may look like an old mouse... and hold on to the ball like one... but is a Curtis Painter experiment REALLY that much better?
"RT @PeterBurnsRadio: Curtis Painter is totally going to get lucky tonight, probably with another girl that looks just like him"
The takeaway from tonight's game: the Colts' run defense was HUGE. And Curtis Painter rightfully owes us all (us especially) a big finger.
This may be a fact!! RT @RaheemBrock Curtis painter will help the colts win their first game! U heard it here first!!!
Dallas!!! Are you ready to come have a great night with us?! We can't wait to blow the roof off with you!
Good luck and have fun! I'm think about ya'll in Dallas today. @DallasBVB @BrunetteInBigD #Fight #Alzheimers
Hope @elianacwg_31  lives it up tonight.. love you mama.. Will visit Dallas soon :))
RT @JakeAustinXXX: @tinroom tonight! Come see me and the hottest gogo boys in Dallas!! @gaypornfanatic @bonepilot
Reminds me of the best night of my life. RT @ayepeeMAXIN: 9am in dallas
Win or lose I think most Dallas fans would agree it's just great to play in games as big as this one tonight again after yrs of mediocrity.
Yep and that might b my move in Dallas tonight RT @AntwannetteBond: True! Tht would b fun.. @Breedlove_08

"#Denali, the great one soaring under the midnight sun". Sarah Palin Sunday July 26, 2009 3pm Farewell Speech.
@morningmika Your morning show is the one thing on any NBC outlet that is worth watching. May God always bless Sarah Palin and her family!
Sarah Palin @jaketapper good talking with you today from Last Frontier! Tune into @CNNsotu to hear our conversation Sunday 9 am12 pm east
She may have said "speak American" but Sarah Palin is right. Any immigrant to a foreign country needs to learn to speak the language there
@magicalvidyacat Seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that SCOTUS used 14th Amendment to override the 10th. @Rinaxas
.@marklevinshow's Friday first hour focused on the SCOTUS unconstitutional redefinition of marriage, and the case of #KimDavis. Excellent!
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
@chrisbraly   SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans
@judgealexferrer I may have missed it if u posted it but what's ur take on #KimDavis situation &amp; @GovMikeHuckabee claims about SCOTUS ruling
@Jakethehater @BrandonSprague @TheDirtJohnson @TaylorADanforth Seinfeld when Kramer is lost and confused, "I'm on the corner of 1st and 1st?

The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
Seinfeld may have not known it at the time. But he made the last sitcom that mattered.
I have work tomorrow but I'm still going to stay up and watch Seinfeld...
Let it be know that @judecomputer enjoys Seinfeld. I may have had to force her to watch episodes, but she has chosen to enjoy them.
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
Seinfeld may be one of the best shows of all time.
Seinfeld tonight tomorrow the night after that
My sick day has consisted of watching Seinfeld and Facetiming and it may be the best day I've had all summer.
Someone come and see Seinfeld with me in November!!!!!!
Impromptu day off tomorrow for an extra long weekend, so I'm treating myself to a pedicure and feeling like I'm in a Seinfeld episode.

Nothing like a rainy Sunday with coffee, Seinfeld reruns and the right amount of laziness.
The editor of 43 episodes of Seinfeld was named "Skip Collector?" That may be the best name in all of editing.
Thursday night Must-See TV hasn't been this comical since the Friends &amp; Seinfeld one-two punch. #GOPDebate
@Morning_Joe I haven't laughed this hard on a Thur night since Seinfeld ended. Not the last episode though, that one was terrible.

To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
kramer is the best character on Seinfeld. George close second, Newman 3rd.
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
Someone needs to make a Video Compilation of all the SAT vocabulary Cosmo Kramer spontaneously uses on Seinfeld
@ChrisDuel sometimes I forget you're 80 years old. Reading the Sunday paper at 5am...you missed the early bird, Seinfeld
I'm on the floor eating left over spaghetti for breakfast and watching Seinfeld while the baby naps. Must be Monday #maternityleave

I just bought tickets to see Seinfeld in Durham next month. What a great Tuesday!
Which on its surface may seem counterintuitive, but the marginal utility of Seinfeld obviously increases at an increasing rate.
Love that Seinfeld episode in the picture https://t.co/BzTPPLzAeB
George's stories may be my favorite thing about Seinfeld - he is so passionate it's wonderful
.@ZachLowe_NBA the Blazers have been cemented as my new 2nd-fave team based solely on how much of a Seinfeld fan Neil Olshey is. #cartwright

@NACHO2813 @Joe_Schmucc But he is shirking the gap between him and Eddie year by year. No one is catching Seinfeld, but he may catch Eddie.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
Little brother just asked me if I'm down to binge watch Seinfeld...there goes my Sunday night lolol.
@becky666 I've been watching Seinfeld since like the 5th grade
@TheBestMicah Hulu you say? This and Seinfeld alone may be worth reactivating my subscription
@sigridellis I may have read that in the way that Seinfeld greeted Newman.
@sethhinz haha! Seriously, though, it reminds me of the Seinfeld character Jimmy. "Jimmy liked worship this Sunday."  #chsocm
@Seinfeld2000 something has been bugging me lately. What if Seinfeld was current day? What if brand new episodes came out every Thursday?

@lentzadam533 yea definitely but I just saw a report that Sting is coming to RAW tomorrow and Taker going be at raw could be interesting
Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night.
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before. I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow.
Sting will be on RAW tomorrow though so that should set up the taker/Sting match
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it
Rumor Roundup (Aug. 24, 2015): Raw tonight, WrestleMania, Sting return, Divas Revolution, more! http://t.co/VRDROEKt0E via @cagesideseats.
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Ric Flair in the ring with Sting tonight! #WWERaw #WCW
And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn
That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24
I honestly think I'm still Marking Out from last night's #RAW... 1st the Dudley Boyz...  Then Ric Flair... And then Sting!! :D #WWE
STING vs. Seth Rollins on September 20th for the World Title! Amazing! http://t.co/xoNwHr5Syx

Even if it's an announced segment, I still mark out when Sting is on my TV on Monday nights. #RAW
#StingonRaw what a great way to start off Monday night Raw with Sting!
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW
He may be 56, but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire. Still awesome on the mic. He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y.
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me.

@nuahs6881 You mean Edge of Tomorrow? It is surprisingly wonderful and I wound up feeling about Tom Cruise the way I did as a kid after
Happy Bank Holiday Monday ! It's raining in the UK so I'm off to the movies later to perv on Tom Cruise lol... http://t.co/Thbz2qc7Rv
Watched Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow last night. Really enjoyed it. Interesting to see Jez Butterworth listed as a writer.
The main man Pedro or shall we call him Tom cruise (cocktail the movie)  @WonderlandLpool Sunday bar skills http://t.co/71Oj5l0aep
good things i saw on the way to work: - car w picture of tom cruise in the 1st mission: impossible movie - "TUSHI DR" license plate
In no particular order, the top three Tom Cruise films are: Magnolia, Edge of Tomorrow and all the Mission Impossibles.
@WhiteHartYid bit like Edge of Tomorrow film, but in that Tom Cruise gets it right in the end unlike Spurs
Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is phenomenal
Get your Wednesday started with Tom Cruise dancing to Ludacris https://t.co/apqyHXiYxA

Rented #scifi #movie "The Edge Of Tomorrow" with Tom Cruise Friday. Really underrated. Hadn't enjoyed a new movie like that in quite awhile.
Just watched "Edge of Tomorrow" and liked it. Mostly because Tom Cruise died a hundred times.
@Aellis994 edge of tomorrow is a well good film! Didn't know he directed that aswell. Im just gonna ignore the critisisms of Tom Cruise
@andycastro @MiklCraw4d ok, so he can pretend he's Tom Cruise in born on the 4th of July and inspirationally drive his butt up here

Theresa May is laying down a marker for the Tory leadership. Tough on immigration and tough on the causes of immigration.
Mrs May doesn't mean it but just wants to be elected Tory leader when Dave steps down Then it will be all smiles @DSORennie @edwardlucas
@pperrin @nellesapelle Very wise. Hard to see UKIP going any further tho. Lab &amp; Tory split may open up new space like you said.
Tory saw me with my physics textbook and she said "I wish you the best of luck may God be with you" y me hecho la bendicion
Tory concerned about carding black kids and the traffic on the Gardiner.He'll speak to the press Wednesday about the Gardiner.
@AllenStarr1 @TrippyPip I'm a Tory voter. I agree with austerity. We are the 5th biggest economy in the world, we can afford to help
Bought crumpets on the way home and thought "Ah, that'll make a nice Saturday morning!" Felt like a Tory voter somewhere in Surrey.
Tory in Wallingford on the 19th!!! Might have to swing thru!!!
@HarrietHarman I may be largely speaking a Tory - but i do massively respect you! Well done and thank you for everything!
not a bit ashamed to say I have preplanned LOTS of jokes about the Queen/parasitology to troll my Tory royalist classmates tomorrow
What is 'amazing',I shd add, is that I went through the University a Tory!Even belonged to Tory group at Uni!1st vote(21)Tory:since, Labour!

Trump: "We may have so much winning when I'm elected that you may get bored with winning." #winning.
I may not be for Trump becoming president but I am happy that he is for stopping the Iran deal.
@Hugodixon I would say Oct are early elections. If Tsipras doesn't hold them then, he will go the way of PASOK &amp; Samaras when held later.
@IrateGreek Correct! When 3rd memo voted and starts bighting in Tsipras likely to go the way of Pasok &amp; ND. Euro? 63% say don't fear drachma

@ekathimerini Far Left has used and uses Tsipras as a wheelbarrow to the microphones, as #Tsipras used #ND and #PASOK before January 25.
@davidicke II believe (from my distant foreign nation) that Tsipras is the sort who who may achieve high diplomacy someday. He is no coward.
@Reuters The snap election will be on 20 September while the opposition groups such as Lafazanis led Popular unity or ND accused Tsipras
Tsipras says that the September 20 elections will provide his party a strong mandate to form a majority government. http://t.co/pWzd4KhDmj

What a difference exactly two months can make. Tsipras faces crowds on 4 July v 4 Sep http://t.co/KZLMWiW9Qd
@Reuters and Fofi Gennimata of Pasok,  as the recent poll also explicitly show, ND may be getting more popularity than Tsipras led Syriza.

Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar may just be interesting #SummerSlam #Raw
@blakersims no shit? he looks awesome. Randy Orton in the 2nd one made me uncomfortable.
I think the best Stan Lee cameo may be in Ant-Man. It had me laughing hard.
The 15 seconds of fame Ansel gets in Paper Towns may have been the best part....

If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
@dontbackdownANM Who do you have winning this Sunday? The Undertaker or Brock Lesnar
Seth Rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of Monday Night #RAW
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
I hope that John Cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp; Seth Rollins is right the future is now. #titlefortitle
John Cena just did more than Seth Rollins ever could to sell that match on Sunday. #SummerSlam #RAW
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch......... This Sunday, Imma make you mines. - @JohnCena to Seth Rollins, lmao that was a great promo."

Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
"@hughcartoons he was like David Abbott's edgier younger brother.  the Elvis Costello to David Abbott's George Harrison, if i may."
Finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see Thor Finish up the 6th
People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
"Put it in the books! Big games for The Captain, Thor, and Granderson. Let's got Matz tomorrow! #LGM"
"Nice win, Thor, Captain America, and the Falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow. #LetsGoMets"
The first one is always the hardest. Way to go Thor!! Looking to tie it up tomorrow night! #LGM #MetsTwitter https://t.co/LPnQoXri1a
"I knew Thor would get the job done. Matz on tomorrow, offense seems to be waking up, Let's Go Mets!!! #LGM"
Here we go boys!!! Great job by Thor tonight!!!! And the Captain!! Huge spot for the Long Island kid Matz tomorrow.
"What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled. We can't go to a game 7 with YV"
Win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with Harvery deGrom and Thor #WontHappenAgain
I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
"I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. Thor is a real life hero. #LGM"
"Thor is the man, this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch"
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!!  https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
"I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday."
So proud of everyone tonight. It's not the end of the season it's the beginning of a new one. Game next Saturday against Curtis 7 pm Mt. T
@Noahsyndergaard  great game &amp; way to make a statement on the 1st pitch.  Very Bob Gibson of u. Beware of Thor the hammer will come! #LGM
@mystery_butt i hope you're ready for March 24  because that's when i transmute into Dark Souls Danielle
@WillingBlam Today's my 21st birthday and it would be awesome if I could get a birthday reply from Thor!
Chase Fourcade with the 8 yard TD run to give @ArchRUMMEL a 7-0 lead over Curtis with 5 seconds left in 1st quarter.
"Congrats to PRX for capping the 1st settlement on Harvest! EU settlements went to FUtilez, Kittens, Dark Souls and Frozen. #dastal"
"I've only had 3 costumes come in tonight, and they were all Marvel.  Thor, Thor, and Wolverine. https://t.co/3zlDihe8ml"
"Drink a Tank 7 every time they say ""Thor"" on the #FOX broadcast and see if you can make it 'til the 5th inning. #BoulevardBeer"

@JHickin it doesn't matter where they play, what matters is they play for Wales, better than England, may I add! (P.s, Ramsey is Arsenal)
Excellent performance tonight from @MCWFC looking to see you against Arsenal next Sunday
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
Thoughts turning to sat &amp; whilst there's obvious concerns if we get at them early as we did at arsenal with a high tempo we can win #LFC
Arsenal will have no trouble finishing 4th and above. We've done it with Chamakh-Bendtner upfront.

@fcbarcelona surprise, surprise! Barca has the upperhand, but it seems Malaga has their 12th man, the ref is so bias. #CampNou #FCBMalaga
Soccer Saturday! Watching Barca with my nerd right now and then going to see the Armada tonight!
Vermaelen the hero for Barca: Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as Barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over Malaga on Saturday ...
@ChampionsLeague @realmadriden @FCBarcelona @LigaBBVA Barca may have more points but Real Madrid play the better football
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
@BenUFO hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?

(Assuming Barca are the best team in the world) Who is the 2nd best in your opinion?
@Mattyy_Official It solves part of the problem but the jigsaw still has some big gaps that need addressing by 6pm tomorrow! Enjoy Barca!
For football fans, it's transfer deadline day. For us, barca fans, its just another Monday :v
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.

Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
Neymar shockingly starts playing for Brazil like he does for Barca https://t.co/RSuKe3s16i
@EhabIbrahim77 Man Utd are a bigger club than everyone besides Real and Barca. They may be at the top of their game by the time he peaks

Dierks Bentley and Eric Church at @countryconcert! Happy 22nd birthday to me! Is it July yet?
Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. #CincyTennis
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday.
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.

I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld
@oreillyfactor @realDonaldTrump @ThePeople4Trump @mikecahall1  the U.S. Open is rockin..Nadal tonite, Federer tomorrow
How to watch Federer and Murray on Tuesday at the 2015 US Open: Roger Federer will begin his 2015 US Open on T... http://t.co/GlxQkdiJZN
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late. Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen
Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop
ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
We're deep in Season 3 of HANNIBAL and Will Graham may have met his match with The Tooth Fairy http://t.co/aHbA8EnCJG http://t.co/fJP8d00hgs
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I'm crying! :O  Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years, and doing your best to keep it there  https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued

Also @unwoman gets into town tmrw! Sunday + Monday I'm going up to Hannibal to see her (and various other friends) at the steampunk expo.

Hi @FANEXPOCANADA - I noticed in the Guide app that there's no mention of the Hannibal photo op on Sunday. Is it still running? Great job!
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru

I start college tomorrow. I think today is the best day to start watching Hannibal
#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
@Vortex566 oo I need to get back in to Hannibal! Did season 1 then just kind of stopped. Yar, started last week. You got kids in tomorrow?
I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so I sticked in and out Hannibal after I realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
Holy shit I just now opened the Hannibal's Kitchen envelope someone handed me Friday night #dragoncon #Hannibal http://t.co/v8DX9Jl0Pv
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday)
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day.
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.

@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better.
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams.
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians

Sitting in my office, window open, sun shining in, listening to my ipod, wondering exactly what the catch is with this job.
1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my iPod which has all the songs I used listen to in 3rd year
I drenched the old iPod nano (6th gen) in isopropanol and it actually worked! The screen will never look the same but totally worth it.
Found my old iPod from like 7th grade and am now realizing I listened to some hood tunes for just a kid!!
I got a new ipod today! hooray! the 6th gen (gold) and ordered my case just now.My life is complete!
may or may not have just found my old iPod w/ JB, Mariah Carey, &amp; Kelly Clarkson on it
I'm not taking my iPod to school tomorrow because I want to have a battery when I go to my concert
@amitbhawani @geekyranjit  ...what are your thoughts about Apple's iPod touch 6th gen?
@jroberts332 @jobot935 [2/2] That's why my Prog/Indie/Heavy Rock-filled iPod has One Direction's 3rd and 4th albums on it. I am Not kidding.
I used to absolutely love the music to Silent Hill. Even had it on my ipod! https://t.co/2UZ23Nn4kX

#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!
Sitting at a curb staring at the White House Listening to jay-z.thats a fine Friday
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting.
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo
Was hoping this would escalate to be something like Nas vs Jay-Z but Meek got KO'ed in the 2nd round lol
[#NEW] Video: Casey Veggies Talks First Meeting With Jay-Z At 17 Years Old, Working Hard to Inspire the Youth http://t.co/3ETpyD7C9o Dec 15,
Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it
I was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning CDs and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of Dipset, old Bone Thugs, and hella Jay-Z
Jay-z may not be the best looking guy, but he proves to others that looks aren't everything
Roadblock: In the immortal words of Jay-Z: "Whatever deity may guide my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight.... http://t.co/mnDysX2NKb
"Jay-Z stole all his music in Reasonable Doubt."  That may be true, but he stole some timeless, genius shit
CRAZY IN LOVE by BEYONCE FEAT. JAY-Z was no.2 in the UK charts on 2 August 2003 https://t.co/rnU7AFDvUY
Would be crazy if Dr. Dre, Eminem, Jay-Z all show up at @Drake's #OVOFest tomorrow. Tonight it's @YG @BigSean @Jeremih @cody_macc @omen #OVO
My following may not be as big as Jay-Z's but I got a solid supportive growing following. Thanks for the love. #TeamM00Y0U
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye.
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z
#WEHO: @ChrisPipkinSC is leading the pack for a THE CARTERS: Lil Wayne, Beyonce, and Jay-Z ride Thursday at 5:30pm! Grab a bike!
Imagine if Ether had dropped in the social media age. We may not have the same respect we do for Jay-z today.
I know it's old, but The Beatles, Jay-Z, Danger Mouse -- c'mon... Classic mix --... http://t.co/Q0ZwccX6Vi
I grew up to this song..didn't knew the 2nd verse is about beyonce..until now.JAY-Z - Lost One ft. Chrisette Michele http://t.co/LYgSbix0Wp
The sun, earth, the Lakers, Jay-Z, Oprah, and 5 whoppers https://t.co/YxJH6KayOw
Prince confirmed that he and Jay-Z will release an album September 7. #PaisleyPark  #Minneapolis
St James Park randomly playing the instrumental for My 1st Song by Jay-Z at half time?  Decent.
Talib, Jay-Z, Kanye, T.I, Big Pooh, Dela, J Dilla, Nas, Pete Rock, 9th Wonder and the legendary Slum Village.
Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence. First time I've been star struck.
From now on I'll try to be more sympathetic towards Freemasons like Jay-Z. When you come from nothing European culture may look like heaven.
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.
#FridayFun! Jay-Z's got that Friday feeling - http://t.co/2uGbXgEASI  Have you?
Who Belong In the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. Jay-Z, Nas or Eminem?
Make a lasting impression on the first day of class tomorrow: walk in with a boom box blaring Public Service Announcement by Jay-Z

Sept 11, 2001-  Good: Jay-Z drops the best rap album of the decade (The Blueprint)  Bad: World Trade Center gets destroyed   #MindBlown
Dreamed I was @Beyonce and I spent the night making out with Jay-Z at a Lower East Side rooftop party until the sun came up.
My nigga @Lightshow10thPL sat down with Jay-Z's right hand man on a rooftop in the city. I'm rootin' for youngin'. Straight up!
"The best part of living in New York is the nightlife. The 2nd best part is knowing that Jay-Z and Beyonce share the same weather as me."
@SeaGlass4Nicole Today was a Jay-Z type of the day. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
@JKailli Although you may know this better than I do since you're from California lol I'm not knocking Jay-Z view in black culture, I say
"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z
Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow! Heard he's bringing out Rih, Bey, Jay-z &amp; Paul McCarthy
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
Today during 6th it was dead silent in the library &amp; all of a sudden my iPad started blasting Jay-Z's voice saying "Motherfucker I got this"
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Jay-Z sat in that Interview like a God showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with Foxy Brown
I knew Jay-z was getting old but I forgot about Eminem. He looks 30 something! https://t.co/fFCMZvL6l9

@50jwquestions Maybe if they make a 3rd one and it will be the last one like the Jurassic Park movies, then yes
@RobotJQ Well it may be jarring. Even playing the Walking Dead, Back the Future, GoT and Jurassic Park games by them I found TFTBL jarring.
Stomach sounds like a Jurassic Park movie &amp; I realize I've had about 800 calories today. Keep this up and I may actually lose weight!

Jurassic World: This 4th Jurassic Park film shows that a movie doesn't need great characters if the dinosaur scenes in it are super awesome
@gagravarr looks like we crossed paths, I saw Jurassic Park at Assembly Roxy on Thursday. Back home now, with sore laugh muscles.

Don't waste $$$ on an unnecessary textbook when you could spend that money to see Jurassic World for an 8th time
Off to see Jurassic World tomorrow at the cinema, any good?? @RoseEllenDix @RoxeteraRibbons

Jurassic World was excellent the only way it could have been better is if @nlyonne was Karen &amp; Claire's 3rd sister http://t.co/TmmcliThHY
The last scene of Jurassic World may be one of the best scenes ever
@cushbomb well his belief that Jurassic World is the 2nd best film of the year pretty much proved that
The vine of Chris Pratt on the set of Jurassic World makes me happy, even if I saw it way back in May....

@Bielsa_1899 @DiMarzio i think it's impossible. Juventus has just sold Llorente, so Zaza is needed as 4th or 5th striker on the bench.
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0

Magic Mike XXL is better than the 1st. I learned a lot about the male stripper psyche &amp; culture (&amp; midlife crisis), &amp; female sexual desire.
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
A FB friend of mine just posted that seeing Magic Mike XXL was the best night of her life. If only she knew what my typical sat night is.
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
I want Magic Mike XXL!!  C'mon? ;)  #hoorayformonday #workwork #nachos #lavinia #novaturient

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship."
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing)
Bale is a great player, Messi may have to drag with him this season, and I think Bale feels strong.
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN
Messi and Ronaldo both go up a rating in FUT 16 with Messi a 94 and Ronaldo 93 Suarez is a 90 as 3rd best player in the game.

Messi takes the number 1 spot 94 rated while Ronaldo comes 2nd rated 93 in FIFA 16 interesting #fifa16 #rivalry
James Rodriguez is fast closing in on the 2nd grade of best footballers (those immediately after Messi and Ronaldo)...

Messi has scored 10+ goals outside Camp Nou for the 6th consecutive season: 25 - 21 - 23 - 27 - 32 - 10 (ongoing)
barcastuff: Messi is the 1st ARG player in history to score against all other 9 Conmebol countries #fcblive [via mrchip]
25 - It has been 25 matches since Messi last produced a hat-trick for Barcelona. His next will be his 25th for the club. Omen?
The 3rd goal scorer of Mauritania just became Messi right there passing five defenders....aowa Bafana Bafana
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol
Iniesta is the 3rd best after Messi and Ronaldo, no one comes close, not Neymar not Hazard #spain

Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'

@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho.
Messi may be the best player in the world but Chicharito is the best player in the universe #ChichaDios @CH14_ http://t.co/BbPKl2CfGj
he was level ffs! also, he may be a problem child but no Argentine forward links with Messi better than Tevez.
the crowds gonna go crazy when Messi comes in for the 2nd half
Okay, I can see how you may not like lebron or Tom Brady but not Messi..this guy has nations on his back.
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10.
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
Proud!! Masche &amp; Messi scored, Neymar &amp; Rafi scored (Tue.), Alba and Iniesta (Sat.) &amp; were the only goalscorers in these games. #interlands
Messi has registered back-to-back hat-tricks (3+ goals) for Barcelona for the 3rd time in his career
@Fraudiesta I agree with Messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.Hazard 2.Suarez 3.Messi
But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d
